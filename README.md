Fetch Quest is a strategy game where the player is competing with computer players to build their trade empire. The game world consists of a series of islands with towns and resources scattered. The goal is to connect towns to the resources in demand. The view is 2D overhead.
	The game is intended to have high replay value, and as such relies heavily on procedural generation, whereby each new game constructs a new map within guidelines and with random factors. This allows the play to have more unique experiences than what we could create manually.
	The game includes procedurally generated islands, towns, and resources. You may make trade routes between resources and towns to try to turn a profit. Rival companies are planned as a later feature. They will be trying to sell the same goods. Another planned feature are pirates disrupting the efforts of all companies. Your goal is to become the #1 distributor of goods, and establish a trade empire!
	The project can be viewed, and compiled more easily by opening the fetch_quest.cbp file in Code::Blocks. Game can be directly downloaded from the windows folder.
